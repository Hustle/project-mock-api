# Hustle Relations Mock API

### Running the API

Install yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) or npm and then run

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Accessing the api

After running the command above you can then make a get request to `localhost:3000/people` for an index of all
the people. Or `localhost:3000/people/${peopleId}` for an individual.

#### For the curious:

This is built with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) which exposes some extra endpoints that
you can play around with as well.
